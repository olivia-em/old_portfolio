Built with React and Three.js, this collection makes the browser a space for 3D concrete poetry. Clicking, rotating, and exploring the 3D environment reveals how meaning changes with perspective; your interaction with the present can unravel the past, illustrating connections that are invisible but felt. Lessons in Perspective offers a poetic meditation on love, memory, and the invisible architectures of life.",

What started as an idea to compare people's lives in the same time frame shifted into an emotional journey, taking a simple walk home and turning it into a reflection on choice. My collaborator Devan and I combined contrasting visuals like high-tech vs. nature and simple vs. grand moments to express the tension between these paths. The final edit mixes jump cuts, flashes, and stills, set to a soundtrack that shapes the narrative. The voiceover, recorded by my partner, Devan, ties together two perspectives: a girl on a personal journey and someone trying to connect. The process was messy but fun, with a focus on creating something that feels raw and emotional. We filmed separately, then brought everything into After Effects for editing. The pacing was driven by audio, which we first cut in Ableton, and then synced to the visuals. After some rounds of edits and a few challenges along the way (always triple-check your backups), we ended up with a piece that combines abstract storytelling and emotional depth.",
