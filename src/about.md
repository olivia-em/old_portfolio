I'm a front-end developer and multimedia artist interested in poetics, audio/visual technology, and creating interactive web art with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a background in English literature, archaeology, and translation, which both informs my creative practice and has strengthened my concept development skills.

My skillset also extends to audio-visual tools like Resolume Arena and Ableton, and fabrication methods including CAD, 3D printing (SLA and FDM), and laser cutting.

At NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program, I've been building my front-end development skills, writing experimental web poetry, and exploring audio-reactive visuals. Beyond my more technical work, I'm passionate about vibe curation—creating playlists, Pinterest boards, collages, and poetry that capture specific emotional experiences.
