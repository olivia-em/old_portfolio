    As the Graduate Teaching Assistant for <i>Alter Egos: Assuming New Identities Through Costume and Performance</i>, I was responsible for preparing promotional materials
  for the end of semester performance. I edited this video in Premiere from footage of previous performances. I wanted the class/performance to seem like an eclectic party, and I played with blending modes to 
  layer performances (especially in pairs) to connect to the concept of duality.
