blurb: |
  I redesigned the New Voices website. They wanted something more modern and accessible, with less scrolling and a new color way. I reorganized the back-end structure of their website, created custom styling, added a newsletter pop-up, and made the website more mobile friendly. The images below are the after & before, and you can visit the website at newvoices.org.
