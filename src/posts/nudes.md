 <div class="cont">
   <p class="desc">
     Tasked with using AI for a short video assignment, I decided to go in a more understated direction. I used excerpts from Anne Carson's Glass, Irony, and God as prompts for image generation in Adobe Firefly. The excerpts I chose are visions that come to the protagonist. Considering the discourse around AI and its relationship to the arts, which frames it as hallucinatory rather than realistic, I thought using these visions as prompts would be fitting.
