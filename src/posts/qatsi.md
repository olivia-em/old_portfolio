     Qatsi (2025)
An homage to the 1982 film Koyaanisqatsi, “Qatsi” is a visual exploration of motion as the axiom of life—spanning the vastness of the cosmos, the rhythms of nature, and the intimacy of human connection.

  Created for the MIT AI Filmmaking Hackathon, Quatsi was recognized as a Finalist and received the Best Sound Award, along with an Honorable Mention for Best Visual.</p>
