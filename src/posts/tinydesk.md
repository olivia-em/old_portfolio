blurb: TinyDesk VJ brings live performance to life through a tactile interface. Powered by p5.js and ML5 body segmentation, it integrates live video with surreal digital effects that you can dynamically control. The interface features rotary encoders, faders, potentiometers, and buttons, allowing you to layer effects like rain, ripples, lasers, and lightning in real-time. Whether you’re performing alongside music or exploring interactive art, this tool offers endless possibilities for creativity. Experiment with the controls, combine elements in unique ways, and watch as your inputs transform into exciting, ever-changing visuals.
